Razor (v1.5.0.0) "Calin Custom" Changelog:

Calin Culianu <calin.culianu@gmail.com>

Note: This version is not from the original developer of Razor, Mark Sturgill.
He hasn't updated Razor in quite some time.  As such, I went ahead and
modified Razor to add some much needed features.  Email me with
questions/comments/hatemail/etc.

* Executables and libraries are no longer cryptographically signed (I lack MS
  Dev keys to do this).
  
* Got rid of the startup update check as it's broken and leads to slow startup
  times.
  
* Added "PlayerMessage" message type to the "If" macro language.  Player
  messages are a subset of system messages, and they are only messages
  originating *on* the player (such as crystals or purple pot countdowns).
  
* Added "=MatchString" syntax to the SysMessage/PlayerMessage "If"
  conditional.  If a string is prefixed with '=', then an exact match is
  performed, rather than the usual substring match.  This is useful for having
  macros such as purple pot counters not get triggered erroneously by any
  message containging eg. '1'. So for purples, set the message to '=1' and
  only strings that exactly match '1' will be matched.
  
* Added 'Exec. delay:' to the macro tab.  The previous default Razor delay for
  macro statements was 50 ms.  This default can get slow with long macros.  So
  now you can set it as low or as high as you like, so that macros with many
  comments or complex macros run FAST. A good value is 5 ms or even 1 ms.
  
* Added 'SysMessage History' config variable to the 'More Options' pane.
  This specifies the number of lines to keep in memory for
  SysMessage/PlayerMessage checks.  Old default was 24.  Useful for complex
  macros that want to keep a lot of state in memory. Note that as usual
  whenever a SysMessage/PlayerMessage matches, the history lines up to that
  match get purged.   This was the way Razor has always behaved and I haven't
  messed with that.  This feature just   allows you to optionally keep track of
  un-processed SysMessages for a longer time, if you   wish.
  
* Got rid of the   really *bad* 'Smart CPU' feature that even Razor docs
  recommend you don't   use.   This feature introduces delays into the protocol
  layer (to save on   polling the network)   and all it can really do is create
  lag without much benefit on modern CPUs.
